# Monaco: SA-MP RolePlay Script
Welcome to the Monaco: SA-MP RolePlay Script for Beginners! This is a custom role-playing script that has been designed specifically for new players who are just starting out with SA-MP. The script comes with a variety of features, including a character registration system in textdraws and car ownership with a dealership (that is currently work in progress).

# Features
- Character registration system in textdraws: The script features an easy-to-use character registration system that allows new players to quickly create their own character in the game.
- Car ownership with dealership (work in progress): The script includes a dealership system that allows players to purchase and own their own cars. While this feature is still a work in progress, it will be fully functional in the near future.
- ORM-Based SQL: Server uses ORM based sql commands, allowing beginners that does not have specific experience in sql language to save and load data from the database.

# Credits
- Credits to realnaith, developer of myserver, that was used as a base for this script.
- Credits to all include developers: Y_Less, samp-incognito, .. and list goes on.

# Installation
To install the Monaco RolePlay, simply follow these steps:

- Download the latest version of SA-MP Client from the official website.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Download XAMPP/WAMP for MySQL (database management tool), and import database monaco.sql from the database folder.
- Adapt SQL settings (if needed) in: gamemodes\utils\db_handler.pwn

# Some functions:
### CreateNewVehicle
`CreateNewVehicle(model, color, usage, Float:posX, Float:posY, Float:posZ, Float:posA, owner_id, owner_name[])`
Creates vehicle that will be saved in the database, with the given parameters. Vehicle will be spawned on the gamemode init. 

### RemoveVehicle
`RemoveVehicle(vehicleid)`
Removes vehicle from the server (destroying it), deletes row in the table, and removes id from the iterator ServerVehicles. Note that vehicle id is not id returned by CreateVehicle/AddStaticVehicle functions, but id generated by `Iter_Free(ServerVehicles)` in load/create functions.

### StartCharacterRegistration
`StartCharacterRegistration(playerid)` simply starts the character registration system in TextDraws for the player.
